## Setup

1. Make sure you have `bower` [installed](https://bower.io/#install-bower): `npm install -g bower`
2. Run `bower install` to download all dependencies
3. Make sure you have `webpack` and `webpack-dev-server` installed: `npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server`

## Running the server

1. Run `webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`
2. Go to [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/)
3. Webpack bundles the files once they are changed, so no need to restart the server to pickup new code!
